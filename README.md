Project's main goal goes step by step on C++ tutorial

## Resources

## Tutorial 
1. Compilers
- Basic C++
	2. Structure of a program
	3. Variables and types
	4. Constants
	5. Assignment and operators
	6. Basic Input and Output
- Program structure
	7. 

### Compilers 
Compiler	Platform				Command
GCC			Linux, among others...	g++ -std=c++0x example.cpp -o example_program

## Basic C++

### Structure of a program (helloWorld.cpp)
Hello World

### Variables and types (variables.cpp)
Identifiers: Reserved words, C++ is case sensitive
Fundamental datatypes: Character, numerical integers, floating-point and boolean
C++ is a strongly - typed language
Introduction to strings:  compound vs fundamental types

### Constants (constants.cpp)
Pre processor definitions

### Assignment and operators (assignment.cpp)
Assignment operator
Compound assignment
Increment and decrement
Relational and comparison operators: short-circuit evaluation, comma operator, conditional ternary operator, explicit type casting operator, sizeof

### Basic Input and Output
Chaining insertion
Standard output (COUT)
Standard input (CIN): getLine, stringstream

## Program structure
Statements and flow control: Selection statements (if - else and switch), Iteration Statements (while, do-while, for-loop, range based loop), Jump statements (break, continue, goto)
